Favorites system was working for a second. Tried to remake it using IDs,
should have committed beforehand because I ended up breaking the whole 
thing. Going to remake the whole favorites system tomorrow with a new 
Favorite component and a "FavBar" component to hold them.

Fixed favorite system. Functional, other than that removing favorites is still pretty buggy.
